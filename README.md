# rpi_gimbal
Single axis gimbal using Raspberry Pi and 6DOF IMU 5 CLICK(ICM-20789).  

## Enabling The SPI Port on the Raspberry Pi
Use the raspbian config tool: 

    sudo raspi-config  
    
Select 'Interfacing Options' and then select the relevant option.   
After rebooting your RPI check if everything is working run:

    ls -l /dev/spidev*

## Enabling The I2C Port on the Raspberry Pi
Use the raspbian config tool: 

    sudo raspi-config  
    
Select 'Interfacing Options' and then select the relevant option.  

Install the I2C tools:  

    sudo apt-get install i2c-tools  
    sudo apt-get update 
    
Reboot the RPI. At the command prompt type one of these depending on whether you are using the I2C0 or I2C1 port:
 
    sudo i2cdetect -y 0  
    //or  
    sudo i2cdetect -y 1

Add the user 'pi' to I2C users so that you don't have to run the I2C tools as root:

    sudo adduser pi i2c

Setting the IÂ²C Bus Speed:  
Edit the /boot/config.txt file and add the following line for 400 kHz bus speeds

    dtparam=i2c_baudrate=400000

## Enabling hardware PWM on the Raspberry Pi
Edit the /boot/config.txt file and add the following line to use GPIO_18 as the pin for PWM0:

    dtoverlay=pwm,pin=18,func=2

After rebooting your RPI check if everything is working run:

    lsmod | grep pwm 

and looking for **pwm_bcm2835**
